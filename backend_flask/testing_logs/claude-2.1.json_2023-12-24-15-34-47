Our program, People Helping People, aims to address this need by creating a framework where people support each other. However, to properly execute this program, we require an influx of funding. \n\nWe are seeking $10 from The Money Foundation which will be specifically allocated towards the components of People Helping People centered on enabling people to help others. With the Foundation's support, we can expand the reach and impact of this program exponentially."

Once these connections are made, we facilitate the exchange of help, whether it be through donations, volunteering, emotional support, or other avenues. \n\nThe $10,000 requested from The Money Foundation will allow us to scale up People Helping People dramatically. We will be able to invest in technology to match people more effectively, fund the outreach needed to identify those needing help, and support the people powered exchanges that are core to our program. With the Foundation's backing, People Helping People can expand and thrive."

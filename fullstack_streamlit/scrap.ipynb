They were content with their unique friendship, a testament to the fact that sometimes, the most unlikely of pairs can be the best of friends.\\n\\nAnd so, Barnaby the beagle and Pip the robin lived happily ever after, their friendship a vibrant song in the quiet countryside, a reminder that true friendship knows no bounds, not even the differences of fur and feather. \\n\"\n","              }\n","            ],\n","            \"role\": \"model\"\n","          },\n","          \"finish_reason\": \"STOP\",\n","          \"index\": 0,\n","          \"safety_ratings\": [\n","            {\n","              \"category\": \"HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT\",\n","              \"probability\": \"NEGLIGIBLE\"\n","            },\n","            {\n","              \"category\": \"HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH\",\n","              \"probability\": \"NEGLIGIBLE\"\n","            },\n","            {\n","              \"category\": \"HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT\",\n","              \"probability\": \"NEGLIGIBLE\"\n","            },\n","            {\n","              \"category\": \"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT\",\n","              \"probability\": \"NEGLIGIBLE\"\n","            }\n","          ]\n","        }\n","      ],\n","      \"usage_metadata\": {\n","        \"prompt_token_count\": 14,\n","        \"candidates_token_count\": 462,\n","        \"total_token_count\": 476\n","      }\n","    }),\n",")"]},"execution_count":8,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["response"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["[parts {\n","   text: \"Tell me a story about a dog and a bird who become friends\"\n"," }\n"," role: \"user\",\n"," parts {\n","   text: \"Barnaby the beagle was a bouncy, curious soul, always sniffing out adventure.

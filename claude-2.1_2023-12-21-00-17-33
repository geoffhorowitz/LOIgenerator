With fertility treatments often costing over $20,000 per cycle, many Jewish couples struggle to afford the treatments they need to build a family. The JFF helps remove financial barriers to fertility treatments for Jewish families. Our mission directly aligns with The Lois & Richard England Family Foundation's commitment to supporting Jewish community life and reproductive health. As the JFF looks to expand our services to the Washington D.C. metro area, we believe the England Family Foundation would make an impactful funding partner for this important program expansion."

For Jewish same-sex couples and single parents, additional barriers exist when trying to build a family. At the same time, having children is deeply tied to Jewish identity and continuity. There is tremendous unmet need for fertility assistance and supportive community among Jewish Washingtonians struggling with infertility. \n\nOur Washington D.C. expansion program aims to directly address this need, providing approximately 15 grants of $5,000 each to help offset the high costs of fertility treatments. With the England Family Foundation's support of $25,000, we can fund 5 additional grants, allowing more Jewish Washingtonians to achieve their dreams of parenthood. These funds will also help us expand our educational and peer support programming tailored to the D.C. Jewish community."

Yet many Jewish individuals and couples face heartbreaking barriers when trying to build a family, leaving them feeling isolated from their community. The Jewish Fertility Foundation envisions a world where the financial burden of fertility does not stand in the way of Jewish continuity and family connections. \n\nThe JFF has over a decade of experience helping Jewish families afford fertility care, but there is tremendous unmet need, especially among the Washington D.C. Jewish community. With the Lois & Richard England Family Foundation's partnership, we can take meaningful steps to support Jewish Washingtonians during an extraordinarily challenging chapter of life. Our Washington D.C. expansion will provide financial, educational and emotional backing to those pursuing parenthood, upholding our cultural traditions around family and belonging. We invite the England Family Foundation to join us in charting a new course for Jewish family building in Washington."
